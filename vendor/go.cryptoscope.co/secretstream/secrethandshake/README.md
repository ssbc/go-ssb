# go-shs

A Go implementation of [dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519)'s [secret-handshake](https://github.com/auditdrivencrypto/secret-handshake).

Two instances of go-shs can secretly shake hands over a connection. The implementation *should* be compatible to the JS implementation but this has not been tested yet.
