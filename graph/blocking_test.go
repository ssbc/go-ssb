/*
Quoting from https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-friends README.md

the relation between any two peers can be in 3 states. following, not following, and blocking.

- following means you will definitely replicate them.
- not following means you might not replicate them, but you might replicate them if your friend follows them.
- blocking means that you will not replicate them. if they are blocked by someone you follow, and you are not following them, then you will not replicate them.
- if a friend of blocks someone, they will not be replicated, unless another friend follows them.
- if one friend blocks, and another follows, they will be replicated but their friends won't be (this is to stop sybil swarms)

this description is awful! we need to reduce this
